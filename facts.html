            <p class="light">All religious variables were related to at least one health behavior. Church attendance was significantly related to physical activity and exercise. In addition, church attendance was significantly related to the use of alcohol and caffeine. Prayer time was significantly related to physical activity, exercise, and alcohol use. The score on the INSPIRIT questionnaire was significantly related to physical activity and was approaching a significant relationship with exercise. The religion subscale of the HBS II questionnaire, which focuses on the belief that religion influences our recovery from illness, was significantly related to alcohol use. (pg 146)  (Nagel, 2007)</p>

            <p class="light">Students who attended religious services once a week or more during their last year of high school reported higher grades at college than non-regular religious attendees. Religious students reported studying more, partying less, and dedicating more time to extracurricular activities. Importantly, controlling for how students spent their time mediated but did not erase the effect of regular religious attendance on college grades earned. pg 14(Mooney,2010)</p>

            <p class="light">Religion helps students focus more on academics and less on distracting activities (VonDras, 2007).
